=We Don't Care=

Oh yeah, I've got the perfect song for the kids to sing and all my people that's...

Drug dealin' just to get by.
Stack ya' money 'til it get sky high.
We wasn't s'posed to make it past 25.
Joke's on you, we still alive.
Throw your hands up in the sky and say:
"We don't care what people say".

If this is your first time hearin' this you are about to experience somethin' so cold, man.
We never had nothin' handed, took nothin' for granted, took nothin' from no man, man, I'm my own man.
But as a shorty I looked up to the dopeman.
Only adult man I knew that wasn't broke, man.
Flickin' Starter coats, man.
Man, you don't know, man.
We don't care what people say.
This is for my n****s outside all winter cause this summer they ain't finna say: "next summer I'm finna".
Sittin' in the hood like community colleges.
This dope money here is Lil' Trey's scholarship.
Cause ain't no tuition for having no ambition and ain't no loans for sittin' your ass at home.
So we forced to sell crack, rap, and get a job.
You gotta do somethin' man, your ass is grown.

Drug dealin' just to get by.
Stack ya' money 'til it get sky high.
Kids, sing! Kids, sing!
We wasn't s'posed to make it past 25.
Joke's on you, we still alive.
Throw your hands up in the sky and say: "We don't care what people say".

The second verse is for my dogs workin' 9 to 5 that still hustle.
Cause a nigga can't shine off $6.55.
And everybody sellin' makeup, Jacob's, and bootlegged tapes just to get they cake up.
We put shit on layaway, then come back.
We claim other people kids on our income tax.
We take that money, cop work, then push packs to get paid.
And we don't care what people say.
Momma say she wanna move South.
Scratchin' lottery tickets, eyes on a new house.
'Round the same time, Doe ran up in dude house.
Couldn't get a job, so since he couldn't get work, he figured he'd take work.
The drug game bulimic, it's hard to get weight.
A nigga's money is homo, it's hard to get straight.
But we gon' keep bakin' til the day we get cake.
And "we don't care what people say".

Drug dealin' just to get by.
Stack ya' money 'til it get sky high.
Kids, sing! Kids, sing!
We wasn't s'posed to make it past 25.
Joke's on you, we still alive.
Throw your hands up in the sky and say: "We don't care what people say".

You know the kids gon' act a fool when you stop the programs for after school.
And they DCFS, some of 'em dyslexic.
They favorite 50 Cent song "12 Questions".
We scream: "rocks, blow, weed, park".
See, now we smart.
We ain't retards, the way teachers thought.
Hold up, hold fast, we make more cash.
Now tell my momma I belong in that slow class.
Sad enough we on welfare.
They tryna put me on the school bus with the space for the wheelchair.
I'm tryna get the car with the chromie wheels here.
They tryna cut our lights out like we don't live here.
Look what was handed us, fathers abandoned us.
When we get them hammers, go on, call the ambulance.
Sometimes I feel no one in this world understands us.
But "we don't care what people say".

Drug dealin' just to get by.
Stack ya' money 'til it get sky high.
Kids, sing! Kids, sing!
We wasn't s'posed to make it past 25.
Joke's on you, we still alive.
Throw your hands up in the sky and say:
"We don't care what people say".

=All Falls Down=

Yeah, this the real one, baby.
Uh, Chi-Town, stand up!
Southside, Southside, we gon' set this party off right
Westside, Westside, we gon' set this party off right

Man, I promise, she's so self-conscious.
She has no idea what she doin' in college.
That major that she majored in don't make no money.
But she won't drop out, her parents'll look at her funny.
Now, tell me that ain't insecurr.
The concept of school seems so securr.
Sophomore, three yurrs, ain't picked a carurr.
She like, "F*** it, I'll just stay down hurr and do hair."
'Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs of new Airs, 'cause her baby daddy don't really care.
She's so precious with the peer pressure.
Couldn't afford a car, so she named her daughter Alexis.
She had hair so long that it looked like weave.
Then she cut it all off, now she look like Eve.
And she be dealin' with some issues that you can't believe.
Single black female addicted to retail, and well.

And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
C'mon, c'mon, and when it falls down.
And when it all falls down.

Man, I promise, I'm so self-conscious.
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches.
Rollie's and Pasha's done drove me crazy.
I can't even pronounce nothin', pass that Ver-say-see!
Then I spent four hundred bucks on this just to be like, "Nigga, you ain't up on this."
And I can't even go to the grocery store without some Ones that's clean and a shirt with a team.
It seem we livin' the American Dream but the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things for the road to riches and diamond rings.
We shine because they hate us, floss 'cause they degrade us.
We tryna buy back our 40 acres
And for that paper, look how low we'll stoop.
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coupe.

Come on, come on.
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
Come on, come on.
And when it all falls down.

I say, "F*** the police," that's how I treat 'em.
We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom.
We'll buy a lot of clothes, but we don't really need 'em.
Things we buy to cover up what's inside.
'Cause they made us hate ourself and love they wealth.
That's why shorty's hollerin', "Where the ballers at?"
Drug dealer buy Jordan, crackhead buy crack and the white man get paid off of all of that.
But I ain't even gon' act holier than thou 'cause f*** it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou before I had a house and I'd do it again cause I wanna be on 106 & Park, pushin' a Benz.
I want to act ballerific like it's all terrific,
I got a couple past-due bills, I won't get specific.
I got a problem with spendin' before I get it.
We all self-conscious, I'm just the first to admit it.

C'mon, c'mon.
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
C'mon c'mon, and when it falls down.
Southside, Southside, we gon' set this party off right.
Westside, Westside, we gon' set this party off right.
Chi-Town, Chi-Town, we gon' show 'em how we get down.
Now, Syleena, you just like a safe belt, you saved my life.

=Spaceship=

I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit.
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky.
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit.
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky.

If my manager insults me again I will be assaulting him.
After I f*** the manager up, then I'm gonna shorten the register up.
Let's go back, back to the Gap.
Look at my check, wasn't no scratch.
So if I stole, wasn't my fault.
Yeah I stole, never got caught.
They take me to the back and pat me askin' me about some khakis.
But let some black people walk in I bet you they show off their token blackie.
Oh now they love Kanye, let's put him all in the front of the store.
So I'm on break next to the "No Smokin'" sign with a blunt in the mall.
Takin' my hits, writing my hits.
Writin' my rhymes, playin' my mind.
This f***in' job can't help him.
So I quit, y'all welcome.
Y'all don't know my struggle.
Y'all can't match my hustle.
You can't catch my hustle.
You can't fathom my love, dude.
Lock yourself in a room doing 5 beats a day for 3 summers.
That's a Different World like Cree Summer's.
I deserve to do these numbers.
"The kid that made that deserves that Maybach!"
So many records in my basement.
I'm just waiting on my spaceship.

I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit.
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky.
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit.
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky.

I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit.
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky.
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit.
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky.

I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit.
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky.
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit.
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky.

=Jesus Walks=

We at war.
We at war with terrorism, racism.
But most of all we at war with ourselves.

God show me the way because the Devil tryna break me down.

You know what the Midwest is? Young and restless.
Where restless n****s might snatch your necklace.
And next these n****s might jack your Lexus.
Somebody tell these n****s who Kanye West is.
I walk through the valley of the Chi where death is.
Top floor the view alone will leave you breathless.
Try to catch it. It's kinda hard.
Getting choked by detectives, yeah, yeah, now check the method.
They be askin' us questions, harass and arrest us.
Sayin' "We eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast."
Huh? Y'all eat pieces of shit? What's the basis?
We ain't going nowhere but got suits and cases.
A trunk full of coke, rental car from Avis.
My mama used to say only Jesus can save us.
Well mama I know I act a fool but I'll be gone 'til November, I got packs to move.

God show me the way because the Devil's tryna break me down.
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now.
And I don't think there's nothin' I can do now to right my wrongs.
I wanna talk to God but I'm afraid cause we ain't spoke in so long.
God show me the way because the Devil's tryna break me down.
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now.
And I don't think there's nothin' I can do now to right my wrongs.
I wanna talk to God but I'm afraid cause we ain't spoke in so long.

To the hustlers, killers, murderers, drug dealers, even the scrippers: Jesus walks for them.
To the victims of welfare feel we livin' in Hell here, hell yeah, Jesus walks for them.
Now, hear ye, hear ye, want to see Thee more clearly.
I know he hear me when my feet get weary.
Cause we're the almost nearly extinct.
We rappers is role models: we rap, we don't think.
I ain't here to argue about his facial features or here to convert atheists into believers.
I'm just tryna say the way school need teachers, the way Kathie Lee needed Regis, that's the way I need Jesus.
So here go my single dog, radio needs this.
They say you can rap about anything except for Jesus.
That means guns, sex, lies, videotape, but if I talk about God my record won't get played, huh?
Well if this take away from my spins, which'll probably take away from my ends, then I hope this take away from my sins and bring the day that I'm dreamin' about.
Next time I'm in the club, everybody screamin' out.

God show me the way because the Devil's tryna break me down.
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now.

=Never Let Me Down=

Get up, I get down.
Get up, I get down.
Get up, I get down.

Get up, I get down.

Get up, I get down.

Get up, I get down.
Get up, I get down.

I get down for my grandfather who took my mama made her sit in that seat where white folks ain't want us to eat.
At the tender age of 6 she was arrested for the sit-ins.
And with that in my blood I was born to be different.
Now n****s can't make it to ballots to choose leadership, but we can make it to Jacob's and to the dealership.
That's why I hear new music and I just don't be feelin' it.
Racism's still alive, they just be concealin' it.
But I know they don't want me in the damn club.
They even made me show ID to get inside of Sam's Club.
I done did dirt and went to church to get my hands scrubbed,
Swear I've been baptized 'least three or four times.
But in the land where n****s praise Yukons and getting paid.
It's gonna take a lot more than coupons to get us saved.
Like it take a lot more than doo rags to get you waves.
Nothing sad as that day my girl's father passed away.
So I promised to Mr. Rainey I'm gonna marry your daughter znd you know I gotta thank you for the way that she was brought up.
And I know that you were smiling when you see the car I bought her.
You sent tears from heaven when you seen my car get balled up.
But I can't complain what the accident did to my left eye.
Cause look what an accident did to Left Eye.
First Aaliyah now Romeo must die.
I know I got angels watching me from the other side.

=Get Em High=

My teacher said I'se a loser. I told her why don't you kill me.
I give a f*** if you fail me.
I'm gonna follow my heart, and if you follow the charts or the plaques or the stacks.
You ain't gotta guess who's back.
You see, I'm so Chi that you thought I was bashful, but this bastard's flow will bash your skull.

Right now she just lamping, chilling on campus.
Sent me a picture of her feelin' on Candice.
Who said her favorite rapper was the late great Francis.
W-H-I-T-E, it's getting late mami.
Your screen saver say tweet, so you got to "call me" and bring a friend for my friend, his name Kweli.
You mean Talib? Lyrics sticks to your rib.

You don't really know him, why is you lyin'?
Yo Kwe, she don't believe me, please pick up the line.
She gon' think that I'm lyin', just spit a couple of lines.
Then maybe I'll be able to give her dick all the time.
And get her high.

=The New Workout Plan=

You just popped in the Kanye West Get Right for the Summer workout tape.

But is it cool to rap about gold.
If I told the world I copped it from Ghana and Mali?
First nigga with a Benz and a backpack.
Ice chain, Carti lens, and a knapsack.
Always said if I rapped I'd say somethin' significant, but now I'm rappin' 'bout money, hoes, and rims again.
And it's still about the Benjamins.
Big faced hundreds and whatever other synonyms, strippers named Cinnamon, more chips than Pentium.
What'cha gon' buy next? Whatever new trend it is.
I'm tryin' to spend my stacks and I'm so broke I look back like "Damn, was I on crack?"

Well, I'm in the club for a limited time.
Act now and get some action for free 99.
Later on I might charge for menage.
Heard her man was the boss of the floss but she still want to toss me the drawers.
And it ain't gon' cost me because she my caddy cuz she grabbed my golf balls in the club.
And I'm still actin' calm den-a-muhh.
She asked "Can you drive me in the hundreds where my Altima was?"
While we drive she tellin' me 'bout problems with her man.

I blow past low class n****s with no cash in the four dot six, bitch you can go ask.
So when I go fast popo just laugh.
Right until I run out of gas or 'til I go crash.
Whatever comes first I'm prepared for the worst.
Whatever comes second I'll be there with my weapon.
Pullin' up in the Lexuses, one on both hand.
So I guess them GSes was ambidextrous.
Coulda sworn her breasteses was sendin' me messages.
"K I need a free hand mammogram.
I got weed, drink, and a Handicam.
All of which is legal in Amsterdam."
So say my name like Candyman and I'mma come and fix you up like the handyman.

Still nowhere to go, still nowhere to go.

Now throw ya hands up hustlers, busters, boosters, hoes.
Everybody, f*** that
Still nowhere to go, still nowhere to go.
And keep ya hands up hustlers, busters, boosters, hoes.

Still nowhere to go, still nowhere to go.

Two words, Chi-town, South Side, worldwide cause I rep that 'til I f***in' die.
One neck two chains, one waist two gats, one wall twenty plaques, dues paid, gimme that.
I am limelight, Blueprint five mics, Go Getters rhyme like, should've been signed twice.
Most imitated, Grammy nominated, hotel accommodated, cheerleader prom-dated, barbershop playa-hated, mom-and-pop bootlegged it.
Felt like it rained 'til the roof caved in.
Two words, Chi-town raised me crazy.
So I live by two words: "f*** you, pay me."
Screamin' "Jesus save me."
You know how the game be.
I can't let 'em change me.
Cause on judgment day, you gon' blame me.
Look, God, it's the same me and I basically know now.
We get racially profiled, 'cuffed up and hosed down, pimped up and ho'd down.
Plus I got a whole city to hold down from the bottom so the top's the only place to go now.

Now throw ya hands up hustlers, busters, boosters, hoes.
Oh, everybody, f*** that.
Still nowhere to go, still nowhere to go.

=Through the Wire=

Yo, Gee, they can't stop me from rappin', can they?
Can they, Hop?

Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall.
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all.
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may.
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way.
Right down to the wire, even through the fire.

I spit it through the wire, man.
There's too much stuff on my heart right now, man.
I'd gladly risk it all right now.
It's a life-or-death situation, man.
Y'all, y'all don't really understand how I feel right now, man.
It's your boy, Kanye to the.
Chi-Town, what's goin' on?

I drink a Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dessert.
Somebody ordered pancakes, I just sip the sizzurp.
That right there could drive a sane man berserk.
Not to worry, Mr H-to-the-Izzo's back to work.
How do you console my mom or give her light support tellin' her her son's on life support?
And just imagine how my girl feel.
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till.
She was with me before the deal, she'd been tryna be mine.
She a Delta, so she'd been throwin' that Dynasty sign.
No use in me tryna be lyin'. I been tryna be signed.
Tryin' to be a millionaire. How I used two lifelines in the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died.
The doctor said I had blood clots, but I ain't Jamaican, man.
Story on MTV and I ain't tryna make a band.
I swear, this right here, history in the makin', man.

Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall.
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all.
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may.
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way.
Right down to the wire, even through the fire.

I really apologize for everything right now.
If it's unclear at all, man.
They got my mouth wired shut.
For like, I dunno, the doctor said like six weeks.
Y'know, he had, I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw.
I looked in the mirror and half my jaw was in the back of my mouth, man.
I couldn't believe it.
But I'm still here for y'all right now, man.
This what I got to say right here, dawg.
Yeah, turn me up, yeah, uh.

What if somebody from the Chi' that was ill got a deal on the hottest rap label around?
But he wasn't talkin' about coke and birds it was more like spoken word.
Except he's really puttin' it down?
And he explained the story about how blacks came from glory and what we need to do in the game.
Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time in the blink of a eye his whole life changed.
If you could feel how my face felt you would know how Mase felt.
Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt.
I swear to God, driver two wanna sue.
I got a lawyer for the case, to keep what's in my safe safe.
My dawgs couldn't tell if I looked like Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky, it was televised.
There's been an accident like GEICO.
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael.
I must got a angel, ‘cause look how death missed his ass.
Unbreakable, what, you thought they'd call me Mr. Glass?
Look back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas Past.
Toys "R" Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash.
And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown-ass kid.
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did.
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph.
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire.

Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall.
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all.
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may.
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way.
Right down to the wire, even through the fire.

Y'know what I'm sayin'?
When the doctor told me I had, um, that I was gonna have to have a plate in my chin, I said "Dawg, don't you realize I'll never make it on a plane now?"
"It's bad enough I got all this jewelry on!"
You can't be serious, man.

=Family Business=

How's your son?
He made the team this year?
Aight, they said he wasn't tall enough.
Ma we here we gon' cook this Sunday ok?
That's a new girlfriend?

This is family business.
And this is for the family that can't be with us.
And this is for my cousin locked down, know the answer's in us.
This why I spit it in my songs so sweet like a photo of your granny's picture.
Now that you're gone it hit us.
Super hard on Thanksgiving and Christmas, this can't be right.
Yeah you heard the track I did man, "This Can't Be Life".
Somebody please say grace so I can save face and have a reason to cover my face.
I even made you a plate, soul food, know how Granny do it.
Monkey bread on the side, know how the family do it.
When I brought it why the guard have to look all through it?
As kids we used to laugh.
Who knew that life would move this fast?
Who knew I'd have to look at you through a glass?
And look, you tell me you ain't did it then you ain't did it.
And if you did, then that's family business.

And I don't care 'bout all the diamond rings.
They don't mean a thing.
All these fancy things.
I tell you that all is my weight and gold.
Now all I know I know all these things.

This is family business.
And this is for everybody standing with us.
Come on, let's take a family Grammy picture.
Abi, remember when they ain't believe in me?
Now she like "See, that's my cousin on TV!"
Now, we gettin' it and we gon' make it and they gon' hate it and I'm his favorite.
I can't deny it, I'm a straight rider.
But when we get together be electric slidin'.
Grandma, get 'em shook up.
Aw naw, don't open the photo book up.
I got an Aunt Ruth that can't remember your name but I bet them Polaroids'll send her down memory lane.
You know that one auntie, you don't mean to be rude, but every holiday nobody eating her food.
And you don't wanna stay there cause them your worst cousins.
Got roaches at their crib like them your first cousins.
Act like you ain't took a bath with your cousins.
Fit 3 in the bed if it's 6 of y'all I'm talkin' 'bout three by the head and three by the leg.
But you ain't have to tell my girl I used to pee in the bed.

Rain, rain, rain go away.
Let the sun come out and all the children say.
Rain, rain, rain go away.
Let the sun come out and all the children say.

I woke up early this morning with a new state of mind a creative way to rhyme without using knives and guns.
Keep your nose out the sky, keep your heart to God and keep your face to the risin' sun.
All my n****s from the Chi, that's my family, dog.
And my n****s ain't my guys, they my family, dog.
I feel like one day you'll understand me, dog.
You can still love your man and be manly, dog.
You ain't got to get heated at every house warmin'.
Sittin' here, grillin' people like George Foreman.
Why Uncle Ray and Aunt Shiela always performin'?
The second she storm out then he storm in.
Y'all gon' sit down, have a good time this reunion and drink some wine like Communion and act like everything fine and if it isn't we ain't letting everybody in our family business.

And I don't care 'bout all the diamond rings.
They don't mean a thing.
All these fancy things.
I tell you that all is my weight and gold.
Now all I know I know all these things.

Some say he arrogant. Can y'all blame him?
It was straight embarrassing how y'all played him.
Last year shoppin my demo, I was tryin' to shine.
Every motherf***er told me that I couldn't rhyme.
Now I could let these dream killers kill my self-esteem or use my arrogance as the steam to power my dreams.
I use it as my gas, so they say that I'm gassed but without it I'd be last, so I ought to laugh.
So I don't listen to the suits behind the desk no more.
You n****s wear suits cause you can't dress no more.
You can't say shit to Kanye West no more.
I rocked 20,000 people, I was just on tour, nigga.
I'm Kan, the Louis Vuitton Don.
Bought my mom a purse, now she Louis Vuitton Mom.
I ain't play the hand I was dealt, I changed my cards.
I prayed to the skies and I changed my stars.
I went to the malls and I balled too hard.
"Oh my god, is that a black card?"
I turned around and replied, "Why yes but I prefer the term African American Express."
Brains, power, and muscle, like Dame, Puffy, and Russell.
Your boy back on his hustle, you know what I've been up to.
Killin y'all n****s on that lyrical shit.

This is the last call for alcohol, for the Mr. Rockefeller.
So get your ass up off the wall.

So this A&R over at Roc-A-Fella, named Hip Hop Picked the "Truth" beat for Beanie. And I was in the session with him. I had my demo with me. You know, like I always do. I play the songs, he's like "Who that spittin?" I'm like "It's me." He's like "Oh, well okay."
Uhh, he started talkin to me on the phone, going back and forth just askin me to send him beats, and I'm thinking he's trying to get into managing producers, cause he had this other kid named Just Blaze he was messin with.

So won't you raise your glass won't you.
So won't you raise your glass won't you.
So won't you raise your glass won't you.
So won't you raise your glass won't you.

And um, he was friends with my mentor, No ID. And No ID told him, "Look man, you wanna mess with Kanye you need to tell him that you like the way he rap."

I was all, I dunno if he was gassin' me or not but he's like he wanna manage me as a rapper AND a producer.

I'm like oh shit. I was messin with, uh, D-Dot also. People were like this, started talking about the ghost production but that's how I got in the game. If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be here. So you know, after they picked that "Truth" beat I was figuring I was gonna do some more work but shit just wasn't poppin off like that. I was stayin in Chicago, I had my own apartment, I be doin like, just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on, and then to go out and buy, get a Pelle Pelle off lay-away, get some Jordans or something or get a TechnoMarine, that's what we wore back then.
I made this one beat where I sped up this Harold Melvin sample I played it for Hip over the phone, he's like, "Oh, yo that shit is crazy Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin, called The Dynasty. And at that time, like the drums really weren't soundin right to me So I went and um, I was listening to Dre Chronic 2001 at that time.And really I just, like bit the drums off "Xxplosive" and put it like with it sped up, sampled, and now it's kind of like my whole style, when it started, when he rapped on "This Can't be Life."

And that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on The Dynasty album. I could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound You know, I got to come in and track the beat and at the time I was still with my other management. I really wanted to roll with Hip Hop cause I, I just needed some fresh air, you know what I'm sayin cause I been there for a while. I appreciated what they did for me but, you know there's a time in every man's life where he gotta make a change. Try to move up to the next level. And that day I came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet Jay-Z and he said, "Oh you a real soulful dude."

And he, uh, played the song cause he already spit his verse by the time I got to the studio. You know how he do it, one take. And he said "Tell me what you think of this." And I heard it, and I was thinking like, man, I really wanted more like of the simple type Jay-Z. I ain't want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the... in my personal opinion. So he asked me, "What you think of it?"


And I was like, "Man that shit tight," you know what I'm sayin', man what I'ma tell him? I was on the train, man, you know. So after that I went back home. And man I'm, I'm just in Chicago, I'm trying to do my thing. You know, I got groups. I got acts I'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin really like poppin' off the way it should have been. One of my homies that was one of my artists, he got signed. But it was supposed to really go through my production company, but he ended up going straight with the company. So, like I'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad news that dude was tryin' to leave my company. And I got evicted at the same time. So I went down and tracked the beats from him, I took that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe about ten days before I had to actually get out so I ain't have to deal with the landlord cause he's a jerk. Me and my mother drove to Newark, New Jersey. I hadn't even seen my apartment. I remember I pulled up I unpacked all my shit. You know, we went to Ikea, I bought a bed, I put the bed together myself. I loaded up all my equipment, and the first beat I made was, uh, "Heart of the City." And Beans was still working on his album at that time, so I came up there to Baseline, it was Beans' birthday, matter of fact, and I played like seven beats. And, you know I guess he was in the zone, he already had the beats that he wanted, I had did "Nothing Like It" already at that time but then Jay walked in. I remember he had a Gucci bucket hat on. I remember it like, like it was yesterday. And Hiphop said, "Yo play that one beat for him." And I played "Heart of the City." And really I made "Heart of the City," I really wanted to give that beat To DMX.

And I played another beat, and I played another beat. And I remember that Gucci bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like 'OOOOOOOOOOH.' Two days later I'm in Baseline and I seen Dame. Dame didn't know who I was and I was like, "Yo what's up I'm Kanye."

"You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay? Yo, this nigga got classics"

You know I ain't talkin shit. I'm like "oh shit." And all this time I'm starstruck, man. I'm still thinking 'bout, you know I'm picturing these n****s on the show, The Streets is Watching, I'm lookin, these were superstars in my eyes. And they still are, you know. So, Jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day, and in two days... I gotta bring up one thing, you know, come back to the story, the day I did the 'Can't be Life' beat on track, I remember Lenny S, he had some Louis Vuitton sneakers on, he think he fly. And Hip Hop was there, I think Ty-Ty, John Meneilly, a bunch of people. I didn't know all these people at the time they was in the room, and I said, "yo Jay I could rap." And I spit this rap that said, uh "I'm killin y'all n****s on that lyrical shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips." And I saw his eyes light up when I said that line. But you know the rest, the rap was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response. He said "man that was tight."

That was it. You know, I ain't get no deal then, hehe. Okay, fast forward. So, Blueprint, "H to the Izzo," my first hit single. And I just took that proudly, built relationships with people. My relationship with Kweli I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper. Because, you know, of course later he allowed me to go on tour with him. Man, I appre-- I love him for that. And at this time, you know I didn't have a deal, I had songs, and I had relationships with all these A&R's, and they wanted beats from me, so they'd call me up, I'd play them some beats. "Gimme a beat that sound like Jay-Z." You know, they dick riders. Whatever. So I'll play them these post-Blueprint beats or whatever and then I'll play my shit. I'll be like, "yo but I rap too." Hey, I guess they was lookin' at me crazy cause you know, cause I ain't have a jersey on or whatever. Everybody out there listen here: I played them 'Jesus Walks' and they didn't sign me. You know what happened, it was some A&R's that f***ed with me though, but then like the heads, it'd be somebody at the company that'll say "naw." Like, Dave Lighty f***ed with me, my nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels. Jessica Rivera, man, I'm not gonna say nothin to mess my promotion up.

Let's just say I didn't get my deal. The nigga that was behind me, I mean, he wasn't even a nigga, you know? The person who actually kicked everything off was Joe 3H from Capitol Records. He wanted to sign me really bad.

Dame was like, "Yo you got a deal with Capitol? Okay man, just make sure it's not wack."


Then one day I just went ahead and played it, I wanted to play some songs, cause you know Cam was in the room, Young Guru, and Dame was in the room. So I played... actually it's a song that you'll never hear, but maybe I might use it. So, it's called 'Wow.'

I go to Jacob with 25 thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow.
I got eleven plaques on my walls right now.
You got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow."
Like the chorus went. Don't bite that chorus, I might still use it. So I play that song for him and he's like "oh shit."

"I ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot."

Like they still weren't looking at me like a rapper. And I'm sure Dame figured, 'like man. If he do a whole album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and save the album, you know. So uh Dame took me into the office, and he's like "yo man, B, B, you don't want a brick, you don't want a brick."

"You gotta be under an umbrella, you'll get rained on." I told Hiphop and Hiphop was all, "oh, word?" Actually, even with that I was still about to take the deal with Capitol cause it was already on the table and cause of my relationship with 3H. That, you know, cause I told him I was gonna do it, and I'm a man of my word, I was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do. Then, you know, I'm not gonna name no names, but people told me, "oh he's just a producer rapper," and told 3H that told the heads of the Capitol, and right-- the day I'm talking about, I planned out everything I was gonna do. Man, I had picked out clothes, I already started booking studio sessions, I started arranging my album, thinking of marketing schemes, man I was ready to go. And they had Mel call me, they said, "yo... Capitol pulled on the deal."


And, you know I told them that Roc-A-Fella was interested and I don't know if they thought that was just something I was saying to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever. I went up... I called G, I said, "man, you think we could still get that deal with Roc-A-Fella?"
