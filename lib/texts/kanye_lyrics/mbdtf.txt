Let's call her names, names, I hate you more.
Let's call her names, names for sure.

On a bathroom wall I wrote "I'd rather argue with you than be with someone else."
I took a piss and dismiss it like "f*** it" and I went and found somebody else.
F*** arguing and harvesting the feelings.
Yo, I'd rather be by my f***ing self.
Till about two a.m. and I call back and I hang up and I start to blame myself.
Somebody help.

Let's play the blame game, I love you more.
Let's play the blame game for sure.
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more.

You weren't perfect but you made life worth it.
Stick around, some real feelings might surface.
Been a long time since I spoke to you in a bathroom.
Gripping you up, f***ing and choking you.
What the hell was I supposed to do?
I know you ain't getting this type of dick from that local dude and if you are I hope you have a good time.
Cause I definitely be having mine and you ain't finna see a mogul get emotional.
Every time I hear bout other n****s is strokin' you.

Let's play the blame game.


Let's play the blame game, I love you more.
Let's play the blame game for sure.

Things used to be, now they not.
Anything but us is who we are.
Disguising ourselves as secret lovers, we've become public enemies.
We walk away like strangers in the street, gone for eternity.
We erased one another.
So far from where we came.
With so much of everything, how do we leave with nothing?
Lack of visual empathy equates the meaning of L-O-V-E.
Hatred and attitude tear us entirely.

But I love to play the blame game, I love you more.

This the Christ year, last year was magic: 32.
Lyrically, can’t none of y’all murder Ye 'cause y’all raps ain’t got no vertebrae.
I got style, ask June if she heard of me.
I killed the fur last Paris, raised the murder rate.
First of all, we all know the beats is like a mix between Fergie and Jesus.
Imagine the direction of this immaculate conception.
Every one of His Majesty’s swim parties is pageantries.
Cannonball off the divin' board when I am bored.
All my homies GDs, but I am Lord.
Rap god, Greek mythology.
And this life too crazy to think logically.
Here’s somethin' that you could use as an analogy: my life is like a child’s illusions become reality.


Hey, feel like one of those old R. Kelly joints, right?
I bet they put me back on the cover of Ebony now.
I know Jet magazine calling right now.
You looking good today too, I like that.
You got your new suit on and she got the extra cute on.
I know you thinking, “This that Yeezy we all love.”
I’m back, baby, we back, baby.
Uncle Charlie, by the way and I’ma let you finish, but I got Beyoncé on the track.
That’s what it is, black excellence, baby.
This is the elite, we the greatest in the world baby, we the greatest in the world!!!
