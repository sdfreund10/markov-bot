Good morning, on this day we become legendary.
Everything we dreamed of.
I'm like the fly Malcolm X, buy any jeans necessary.
Detroit Red cleaned up.
From the streets to the league, from an eighth to a key, but you graduate when you make it up outta the streets.
From the moments of pain, look how far we done came.
Haters saying you changed, now you doing your thang.

Good morning!
Good morning!
Good morning!
Good morning!

Good morning, look at the valedictorian, scared of the future while I hop in the DeLorean.
Scared to face the world, complacent career student.
Some people graduate, but be still stupid.
They tell you read this, eat this, don't look around.
Just peep this, preachers, teach us, Jesus.
Okay look up now, they done stole yo' streetness after all of that you received this.

Good morning!
Hustlers that's if you're still living, get on down.

=Champion=

Did you realize that you were a champion in their eyes?

Yes I did.
So I packed it up and brought it back to the crib.
Just a little something, show you how we live.
Everybody want it but it ain't that serious.
Mhm, that's that shit.
So if you gon' do it, do it just like this.

Did you realize that you were a champion in their eyes?

You don't see just how wild the crowd is.
You don't see just how fly my style is.
I don't see why I need a stylist when I shop so much I can speak Italian.
I don't know, I just want it better for my kids and I ain't sayin' we was from the projects, but every time I wanted layaway or a deposit my dad'd say "when you see clothes, close your eyelids."
We was sort of like Will Smith and his son.
In the movie,I ain't talkin' 'bout the rich ones.
Cause every summer, he'd get some brand new harebrained scheme to get rich from.
And I don't know what he did for dough, but he'd send me back to school with a new wardrobe.

Did you realize that you were a champion in their eyes?

I think he did when he packed it up and brought it back to the crib.
Just a little somethin', show you how we live.
Everything I wanted, man it seem so serious.
Mhm, that's that shit, so if you gon' do it, do it just like this

Did you realize that you were a champion in their eyes?

When it feel like living's harder than dyin'.
For me givin' up's way harder than tryin'.
Lauryn Hill said her heart was in Zion.
I wish her heart still was in rhymin'.
'Cause who the kids gon' listen to, huh?
I guess me if it isn't you.
Last week I paid a visit to the institute.
They got the dropout keepin' kids in the school.
I guess I cleaned up my act like Prince'd do.
If not for pleasure, then at least for the principle.
They got the CD, they got to see me drop gems like I dropped out of PE.
They used to feel invisible.
Now they know they invincible.

Did you realize that you were a champion in their eyes?

Yes I did.
So I packed it up and brought it back to the crib.
Just a little somethin', show you how we live.
Everybody want it, but it ain't that serious.

There's a thousand you's, there's only one of me.

These dreams be waking me up at night.
You say I think I'm never wrong.
You know what, maybe you're right, aight.

You say he get on your f***ing nerves.
You hope that he get what he deserves, word.
Do you even remember what the issue is?
You just trying to find where the tissue is.
You can still be who you wish you is.
It ain't happen yet and that's what intuition is.
When you hop back in the car drive back to the crib, run back to their arms the smokescreens, the chokes and the screams...
You ever wonder what it all really means?

And I'm back on my grind.
A psychic read my lifeline told me in my lifetime my name would help light up the Chicago skyline.
That's why I'm seven o'clock, that's primetime.
Heaven'll watch, God calling from the hotlines.
Why he keep giving me hot lines?
I'm a star, how could I not shine?
How many ladies in the house?
How many ladies in the house without a spouse?
Something in your blouse got me feeling so aroused.
What you about?
On that independent shit.
Trade it all for a husband and some kids.
You ever wonder what it all really mean?
You wonder if you’ll ever find your dreams?

Have you ever popped champagne on a plane, while gettin' some brain.
Whipped it out, she said "I never seen Snakes on a Plane".
Whether you broke or rich you gotta get this,
Havin' money's not everything, not havin' it is.
I was splurgin' on Tryst, but when I get my card back activated, I'm back to Vegas.
Cause I always had a passion for flashin' befo' I had it, I closed my eyes and imagined the good life.
The good life.

=Can't Tell Me Nothing=

Wait 'til I get my money right.

I had a dream I could buy my way to heaven.
When I awoke, I spent that on a necklace.
I told God I'd be back in a second.
Man it's so hard not to act reckless.
To whom much is given, much is tested.
Get arrested guess until he get the message.
I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny, and what I do, act more stupidly.
Bought more jewelry, more Louis V.
My Momma couldn't get through to me.a
The drama, people suing me.
I'm on TV talking like it's just you and me.
I'm just saying how I feel man.
I ain't one of the Cosby's, I ain't go to Hillman.
I guess the money should've changed him.
I guess I should've forgot where I came from.

Wait 'til I get my money right.
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?
Excuse me, was you saying something?
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing.

Old folks talking 'bout, "Back in my day."
But homie this is my day, class started 2 hours ago, oh am I late?

They say I talk with so much emphasis.

He don't even stop to get gas
If he can move through the rumors, he can drive off of fumes 'cause how he move in a room full of no's?
How he stay faithful in a room full of hoes?
Must be the pharaohs, he in tune with his soul so when he buried in a tomb full of gold.
Treasure, what's your pleasure?
Life is a, UH, depending how you dress her.
So if the Devil wear Prada, Adam Eve wear nada I'm in between but way more fresher.

What people pay paper for damn it, they can't stand it.
They want something new, so let's get reacquainted.
Became the hood favorite, I can't even explain it, I surprise myself too.

Life of a Don. Lights keep glowing.
Coming in the club with that fresh shit on, with something crazy on my arm.
Uh-uh-hum, and here's another hit, Barry Bonds.

Dude! Fresh off the plane, Konnichiwa, bitches.
Turn around another plane, my passport on pivot.
Ask for it I did it, that asshole done did it.
Talked it then he lived it, spit it then he shit it.
I don't need writers, I might bounce ideas, but only I could come up with some shit like this.
I done played the underdog my whole career.
I've been a very good sport, haven't I, this year.
They say "he going crazy and we seen this before."
But I'm doing pretty good as far as geniuses go.
And I'm doing pretty hood in my pink polo.
n**** please, how you gonna say I ain't no Lo-head?
'Cause my Dior got me more model head.
I'm insulted, you should go 'head and bow so hard until your knees hit your forehead.
And the flow just hit code red.
Top 5 MCs, you ain't gotta remind me.
Top 5 MCs: you gotta rewind me.
I'm high up on the line, you could get behind me but my head's so big you can't sit behind me.

Life of a Don, lights keep glowing.

Did she say she want a brewski?
All of these drunk and hot girls.

=Flashing Lights=

She don't believe in shootin' stars, but she believe in shoes and cars, wood floors in the new apartment, couture from the store's departments.
You more like "love to start shit."
I'm more of the trips to Florida, ordered the hors d'oeuvres, views of the water, straight from a page of your favorite author.
And the weather so breezy.
Man, why can't life always be this easy?
She in the mirror dancin' so sleazy.
I get a call, like, "Where are you, Yeezy?"
And try to hit you with the ol-wu-wopte.
'Til I got flashed by the paparazzi.
Damn, these n****s got me.
I hate these n****s more than a Nazi.

I know it's been a while, sweetheart we hardly talk, I was doin' my thang.
I know it was foul, baby, aye, babe, lately, you've been all on my brain.
And if somebody would've told me a month ago.
Frontin' though: yo, I wouldn't wanna know.
If somebody would've told me a year ago it'll go get this difficult.
Feeling like Katrina with no FEMA.
Like Martin with no Gina.
Like a flight with no visa.
First class with the seat back, I still see ya.
In my past, you on the other side of the glass of my memory's museum.
I'm just sayin', hey, Mona Lisa, come home, you know you can't roam without Caesar.

=Everything I Am=

Damn, here we go again.
Common passed on this beat, I made it to a jam.
Now everything I'm not made me everything I am.
Damn, here we go again.
People talking shit, but when the shit hit the fan, everything I'm not made me everything I am.

I'll never be picture-perfect Beyoncé, be light as Al B or black as Chauncey.
Remember him from Blackstreet? He was as black as the street was.
I'll never be as laid back as this beat was
I never could see why people reach a fake-ass facade that they couldn't keep up.
You see how I creeped up?
You see how I played a big role in Chicago like Queen Latifah?
I'll never rock a mink coat in the wintertime like Killa Cam or rock some mink boots in the summertime like will-i-am.
Let me know if you feel it, man 'cause everything I'm not made me everything I am.

Damn, here we go again.
Everybody saying what's not for him, but everything I'm not made me everything I am.
Damn, here we go again
People talking shit, but when the shit hit the fan, everything I'm not made me everything I am.

And I'm back to tear it up.
Haters start your engines, I hear 'em gearing up.
People talk so much shit about me at barbershops they forget to get their hair cut.
Okay, fair enough
The streets is flaring up 'cause they want gun talk, or I don't wear enough baggy clothes, Reeboks, or A-di-dos.
Can I add that he do spaz out at his shows?
So say goodbye to the NAACP Award.
Goodbye to the India Arie Award.
They'd rather give me the N-n**** Please Award, but I'll just take the I Got a Lot of Cheese Award.

Damn, here we go again.
Everybody saying what's not for him, but everything I'm not made me everything I am.
Damn, here we go again
People talking shit, but when the shit hit the fan, everything I'm not made me everything I am.

I know people wouldn't usually rap this but I got the facts to back this.
Just last year, Chicago had over 600 caskets.
Man, killing's some wack shit.
Oh, I forgot, 'cept for when n****s is rappin'.
Do you know what it feel like when people is passin'?
He got changed over his chains a block off Ashland.

Everybody saying what's not for him, but everything I'm not made me everything I am.
Damn, here we go again
People talking shit, but when the shit hit the fan, everything I'm not made me everything I am.

Class back in session so I upped it a grade.
In two years Dwayne Wayne became Dwyane Wade.
And hey, please don't start me.
I'm like Gnarls Barkley meets Charles Barkley.
I'm pop the Barkers. I'm hood the Parkers.
While y'all was in limbo I raised the bar up.
I touched on everything.
Married to the game, rock a chain 'steada wedding ring.
Y'all bridesmaids catch the garter.
On nights when 'Ye romance, cameras flash so much that I gotta do that Yayo dance.
I'm on a world tour with Common, my man.
After each and every show a couple dykes in the van.
It's easy.
The hood love to listen to Jeezy and Weezy.
And, oh yeah, Yeezy.
I did it for the glory.

What am I supposed to do now?
Man the game all messed up.
How I'm suppose to stand out when everybody get dressed up?
So yeah, at the Grammys I went ultra Travolta.
Yeah that tuxedo might have been a little guido.
But with my ego I can stand there in a Speedo and be looked at like a f***ing hero.
The glory, the story, the chain, the polo, the night, the grind, the empty bottles of No-Doz.
Tank on empty, whipping my mamma's Volvo.
I spent that gas money on clothes with logos.
The fur is Hermes, shit that you don't floss.
The Goyard so hard man, I'm Hugo's boss.
Why I gotta ask what that TUDOR cost?
House on the hill.
Two doors from Tracey Ross.
And I'm asking about her girlfriends, yeah, the dark skin'ed ones.
She asking about the speed boats yeah I admit we rented 'em.
When you meet me in person what do you feel like?
I know, I know I look better in real life.
I hear people compare themselves to big a lot.
You know B.I.G. and Pac, you know to get it hot.
I guess after I live I wanna be compared to B.I.G.
Any one: Big Pun, Big L or Notorious.
'Till then, get money and stunt and stay glorious.
And I'm gonna stop killing these n****s soon as the chorus hit.
Yeah I'mma stop killing these n****s soon as the chorus hit.
These haters be killing themselves they wanna come and get the glory.

=Homecoming=

And you say Chi city!
Chi city! Chi city!

I met this girl when I was 3 years old and what I loved most, she had so much soul.
She said, "Excuse me, lil homie, I know you don't know me but my name is Windy and I like to blow trees."
And from that point I never blow her off.
n****s come from out of town, I like to show her off.
They like to act tough, she like to tore 'em off and make 'em straighten up their hat ‘cause she know they soft.
And when I grew up, she showed me how to go downtown.
In the nighttime her face lit up, so astoundin'.
I told her in my heart is where she'll always be.
She never messed with entertainers cause they always leave.
She said, "It felt like they walked and drove on me."
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me.
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me.
She said, "'Ye, keep making that, keep making that keep making that platinum and gold for me!"

But if you really cared for her, then you wouldn't have never hit the airport to follow your dreams.
Sometimes I still talk to her, but when I talk to her it always seems like she talking 'bout me.
She said, "You left your kids, and they just like you they wanna rap and make soul beats just like you but they just not you" and I just got through."
Talking 'bout what n****s tryin' to do: just not new,
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong.
I guess you never know what you got 'til it's gone.
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home and guess when I heard that? When I was back home.
Every interview I'm representin' you, makin' you proud.
Reach for the stars so if you fall, you land on a cloud.
Jump in the crowd, spark your lighters, wave 'em around.
If you don't know by now, I'm talking 'bout Chi-Town

=Big Brother=


My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother.
Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother.
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend.
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin.

It's the Hard Knock Life Tour, sellout.
Picture us in the mall, coppin' Iceberg and yell out "Jigga."
Yeah, that's what we'll yell out, yell out.
You know the name do I gotta spell out or tell 'bout J-A-Y, and 'Ye so shy.
Now he won't even step to his idol to say hi.
Standing there like a mime and let the chance pass by.
Back of my mind, "He could change your life."
With all these beats I did, at least let him hear it.
At least you can brag to ya friends back at the gig."
But he got me out me out my momma crib.
Then he help me get my momma a crib.

My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother.
Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother.
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend.
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin.
Let the story begin.
If you feel the way I feel why don't you wave your hands?
 

Fresh off the plane, I'm off to Baseline.
Nothing handed out, I'm 'bout to take mine.
'Round the same time of that Blueprint 1 and these beats in my pocket was that blueprint for him.
I'd play my little songs in that old back room.
He'd bob his head and say "Damn! Oh, that's you?"
But by The Black Album, I was blacking out.
Partyin' S.O.B.'s and we had packed a crowd.
Big brother got his show up at Madison Square and I'm like "Yeah, yeah, we gon' be there" but not only did I not get a chance to spit it, Carline told me I could buy two tickets.
I guess big brother was thinkin' a little different and kept little brother at bay, at a distance.
But everything that I felt was more bogus.
Only made me more focused, only wrote more potent.
Only thing I wanna know is why I get looked over.
I guess I'll understand when I get more older.
Big brother saw me at the bottom of the totem.
Now I'm on the top and everybody on the scrotum.

My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother.
Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother.
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend.
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin.
Let the story begin.
If you feel the way I feel why don't you wave your hands?

Have you ever walked in the shadow of a giant?
Not only a client, the Presidito, hola, Hovito.
The game gettin' foul so here's a free throw.
I was always on the other side of the peephole.
Then I dropped "Jesus Walks" now I'm on the steeple.
And we know, "New Jack City" got to keep my brother, but to be number one I'mma beat my brother.
On that "Diamonds" remix I swore I spazzed.
Then my big brother came through and kicked my ass.
Sibling rivalry, only I could see it was the pride in me that was drivin' me.
At the Grammys I said, "I inspired me", but my big brother who I always tried to be.
When I kicked a flow it like pick-and-roll cause even if he gave me the rock, it's give-and-go.
I guess Beanie's style was more of a slam dunk but my shit was more like a finger roll.
But I had them singles though and them hoes at the show gonna mingle, yo, heh, y'all know.
I told Jay I did a song with Coldplay.
Next thing I know he got a song with Coldplay.
Back in my mind I'm like, "Damn, no way."
Translate, español: "No way, José."
Then I went and told Jay Brown.
Shoulda known that was gonna come back around.
Shoulda talked to you like a man, shoulda told you first.
But I told somebody else and that's what made shit worse.
 

My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother.
So here's a few words from ya kid brother.
If you admire somebody you should go on 'head tell 'em.
People never get the flowers while they can still smell 'em.
A idol in my eyes, god of the game.
Heart of the City, Roc-a-Fella chain.
Never be the same, never be another.
Number one, Young Hov, also my big brother.

My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother.
Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother.
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend.
No I.D., my mentor, and that's where the story ends.

Toomp killed this shit.
