=On Sight=

Yeezy season approachin'.
F*** whatever y'all been hearin'.
F*** what, f*** whatever y'all been wearin'.
A monster about to come alive again soon as I pull up and park the Benz.
We get this bitch shaking like Parkinsons.
Take my number and lock it in.
Indian hair, no moccasins.
It's too many hoes in this house of sin.
Real n**** back in the house again.
Black Timbs all on your couch again.
Black dick all in your spouse again, and I know she like chocolate men.
She got more n****s off than Cochran, hah!

On sight, on sight.

How much do I not give a f***?
Let me show you right now 'fore you give it up.
How much do I not give a f***?
Let me show you right now 'fore you give it up.
 
He'll give us what we need.
It may not be what we want.

Baby girl tryna get a nut and her girl tryna give it up.
Chopped 'em both down.
Don't judge 'em, Joe Brown.
One last announcement: no sports bra, let's keep it bouncin'.
Everybody wanna live at the top of the mountain.
Took her to the 'Bleau, she tried to sip the fountain.
That when David Grutman kicked her out but I got her back in and put my dick in her mouth.

On sight, on sight.

Right now.
I need right now.

=Black Skinhead=

For my theme song: black.
My leather black jeans on, black.
My by-any-means on.
Pardon, I'm getting my scream on.
Enter the kingdom: black.
But watch who you bring home.
They see a black man with a white woman at the top floor they gone come to kill King Kong.
Middle America packed in: black.
Came to see me in my black skin.
Number one question they're askin': f*** every question you askin'.
If I don't get ran out by Catholics, here come some conservative Baptists claiming I'm overreactin' like them black kids in Chiraq bitch.

Four in the mornin', and I'm zonin'.
They say I'm possessed, it's an omen.
I keep it 300, like the Romans.
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby we livin' in the moment.
I've been a menace for the longest.
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted and you know it, and you know it.

So follow me up cause this shit 'bout to go down.
I'm doing 500, I'm outta control now.
But there's nowhere to go now and there's no way to slow down.
If I knew what I knew in the past I would've been blacked out on your ass.

Four in the mornin', and I'm zonin'.

Stop all that coon shit.
Early morning cartoon shit: black.
This is that goon shit.
F*** up your whole afternoon shit.
I'm aware I'm a wolf soon as the moon hit.
I'm aware I'm a king.
Back out the tomb bitch.
Black out the room, bitch.
Stop all that coon shit.
These n****s ain't doin' shit.
Them n****s ain't doin' shit.
Come on homie what happened.
You n****s ain't breathin', you gaspin'.
These n****s ain't ready for action.
Ready-ready for action.

Four in the mornin', and I'm zonin'.
They say I'm possessed, it's an omen.
